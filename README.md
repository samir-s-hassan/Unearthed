## How to run
1. Open two tabs on your terminal
2. Both tabs should have you starting at the root of this project repository 
3. Run "cd client" on one terminal tab and "cd server" on the other terminal tab
4. Run "npm install" to make sure you have all the necessary dependencies/packages
5. Now that you have the client and server directories open on different tabs, run "npm install" within each tab to make sure you have all the necessary dependencies for the client and the server
6. Run "npm start" on the server-side and this will get our server started on a port!
7. Run "npm run build" and then "npm run dev" on the client-side and this will get our client started on a port
